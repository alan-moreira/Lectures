april30- I did most of chapter 15
     IT remains to add section on tail risks and background risks
     There still need some clean up
     In particular need to shift the data pointers to github
     I believe it is only GFD and the pike data sets that I download from WRDS
     The the mateiral for equilbrium thinking is mostly in the LEFTOVERS notebook
     Maybe I should add to the using API datareader and wrds
     Have to decide I am goign to do code snippets thing

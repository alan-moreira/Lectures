april30- I did most of chapter 15
     IT remains to add section on tail risks and background risks
     There still need some clean up
     In particular need to shift the data pointers to github
     I believe it is only GFD and the pike data sets that I download from WRDS
     ok: The the mateiral for equilbrium thinking is mostly in the LEFTOVERS notebook
     Maybe I should add to the using API datareader and wrds
     Have to decide I am goign to do code snippets thing
may2
     need to add info to other tradign strategies PEAD and Profitabiltiy
     Implementation needs work, perhaps use the AQR ppaper for plots to illustrate how transaction costs can impact stuff

    ok: Multifactor is close to good, I think
     ok: didn't start on equilbrium. Only created file
